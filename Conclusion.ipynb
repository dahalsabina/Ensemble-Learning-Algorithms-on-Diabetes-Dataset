    "Accuracy: GradientBoosting shows better accuracy (96.58%) compared to Random Forest (95.51%). This suggests that GradientBoosting generally performs better across all test instances, correctly classifying a higher percentage of total cases.\n",
    "Precision: GradientBoosting has a notably higher precision (91.21%) than Random Forest (85.67%). Higher precision indicates that GradientBoosting has a lower rate of false positives, meaning it is less likely to label a non-diabetic patient as diabetic.\n",
